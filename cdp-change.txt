Hello [Coachee's Name],

Hope this message finds you well and navigating the day's challenges with aplomb. By now, I trust you've read the recent email from STG discussing some rather exciting changes in the way we approach career development.

In the new setup, you have the control and accountability of your career capitalâ€”quite empowering, isn't it? The support, tools, and resources you've been accustomed to remain at your disposal, but the decision to utilize them rests squarely on your shoulders.

This change isn't about lessening support but channeling it to those who actively seek it. As your CDP Coach, I'm still here, ready and eager to help whenever you feel you need guidance.

Should you wish to discuss your Career Development Plan (CDP), have any general queries, or need help with code, reaching out has been made simpler. Schedule a time that suits you using this [Calendly link](https://calendly.com/jared-whipple/check-in), and we can convene to tackle any questions or challenges you might be facing.

Stay curious and stay motivated,

[Your Name]
