Hello [Coachee's Name],

I hope this message finds you well and in the flow of good work. By now, you might have read the recent STG memo. If it's still unopened in your inbox, give it a lookâ€”it's rather enlightening, and potentially career-shaping.

It appears we're in for a bit of an evolution in how we approach our development here at STG. The curtains have been drawn back, and it seems the spotlight is now firmly on you. You are in the driver's seat of your career journey, with your CDP Coach, yours truly, transitioning to the role of a friendly, on-call advisor. I'm here to guide you when you ask for it, leaving the reins in your capable hands.

Your Success Manager is donning a new hat, that of a co-navigator, always ready to provide personalized advice for your unique journey. This new role enables them to help you address any marketability opportunities or risks, keeping your career on the right track.

STG's email laid out the vision quite clearly: we're moving towards an environment where you have the control and the accountability of your own career capital. It's quite empowering, isn't it? The tools and resources are still available to you, but the choice to use them is entirely yours.

The goal is not to reduce the level of support but to channel it more efficiently, focusing on those who seek it. So, if you ever feel like you're veering off your path or encounter a fork in the road, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here, ready to guide you.

This change embodies an air of grounded optimism, with a hint of stoic wisdom. We're in this together and, as always, I look forward to supporting you in this journey.

Wishing you all the best,

[Your Name]
