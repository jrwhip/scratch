Hello [Coachee's Name],

I hope this message finds you well and tackling the day with gusto. By now, I'm sure you've seen the recent STG email outlining some significant changes.

STG's email outlined this new vision quite clearly: we're creating an environment where you are in control of your career capital. Rather exciting, don't you think? The tools and resources are all yours to use, but the choice to pick them up is yours and yours alone.

The idea here is not to limit the support but to streamline it, focusing on those who seek it. So, if you ever find yourself lost or at a crossroad, do reach out. I'm here and ready to help.

If you wish to discuss your Career Development Plan (CDP), have general questions, or need guidance with code, I've made it even easier for you to reach out. Simply schedule a time that works best for you using this [Calendly link](https://calendly.com/jared-whipple/check-in), and we can meet up to address any queries or challenges you may have.

Stay curious,

[Your Name]
