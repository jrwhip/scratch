## Development server

To serve your application during development, run the command `npm start`. If you want to serve your application with a local backend, use the command `npm run start-local`.

## Understand this workspace

Run `npx nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Scripts

This workspace uses a variety of scripts for running the development server, building the application, testing, linting, and more:

- `npm start`: Serve the application for development.
- `npm run start-local`: Serve the application with a local backend.
- `npm run build`: Build the application for production.
- `npm run build-dev`: Build the application for development.
- `npm run build-qa`: Build the application for QA.
- `npm run build-test`: Build the application for testing.
- `npm run build-prod`: Build the application for production.
- `npm test`: Run tests.
- `npm run lint`: Lint the project.
- `npm run format:write`: Format the code.
- `npm run format:check`: Check the code formatting.
- `npm run reset`: Reset the Nx cache.
- `npm run affected:apps`: Print affected applications.
- `npm run affected:manifest`: Print affected manifest.

## Dependencies

This workspace uses a variety of libraries and frameworks:

- `fullcalendar`: FullCalendar is a powerful and fully-featured calendar component, highly customizable and includes multiple plugins for varied functionality. It's flexible enough to fetch events on-the-fly and is themeable to match your application style.

- `@fortawesome (Font Awesome)`: Font Awesome provides a collection of scalable vector icons that can be customized with CSS. They are used across the monorepo to standardize the icons used in the UI while keeping the style consistent.

- `bootstrap`: Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. It's used to leverage its collection of ready-made front-end components, grid system, and utilities, enabling the quick building of responsive layouts.

- `ag-grid`: ag-Grid is a feature-rich datagrid designed for the major JavaScript Frameworks. It provides a generic way to display and interact with data in a tabular format, offering functions like sorting, filtering, grouping, and more out of the box.

- `primeng`: While PrimeNG is a library for Angular with rich UI components, it's preferred to use ag-grid and bootstrap. This is because the PrimeNG upgrade process with each version of Angular can be time-consuming. Both bootstrap and ag-grid were chosen as they have a release cycle that's not tightly coupled with Angular, which makes upgrades more manageable.
