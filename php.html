      TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. To put it another way, TypeScript
      is JavaScript but with additional features, the most notable of which are static types.

      JavaScript, as you might already know, is dynamically typed. This means you can have a variable that's initially a
      string, then later becomes a number, and JavaScript won't complain. While this flexibility can be useful in some
      cases, it can also lead to potential bugs that are hard to detect and debug. For example, if you pass a string to
      a function that's expecting a number, JavaScript won't raise an error until runtime when the function tries to
      perform a numeric operation on that string.

      Enter TypeScript. TypeScript introduces static typing to the mix. Static typing allows you to declare the types of
      your variables, function parameters, and function return values. The TypeScript compiler will then check these
      types at compile-time and raise an error if there's a type mismatch.

  <summary>Vue</summary>
  <h4 id="bkmrk-description-of-vue">Description of Vue</h4>
  <p>Vue.js is a JavaScript framework that enables developers to build dynamic user interfaces for web applications. It
    follows a component-based architecture, allowing the creation of reusable UI components. With its
    declarative syntax, Vue simplifies the management of UI structure and offers a reactive data binding system. This means that
    the UI automatically updates when data changes. It is important to also know how to leverage both the Options and Composition APIs.</p>
  <h4 id="bkmrk-vue-mastery">Vue Mastery</h4>
  <p>For L3 mastery, focus on the following key features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="null">
      <b>Components:</b> Vue's component-based architecture allows you to break down your UI into reusable components.
      Understanding how to create, use, and communicate between components is essential.
    </li>
    <li class="null">
      <b>Directives:</b> Vue provides built-in directives such as `v-if`, `v-for`, and `v-bind` that allow you to
      manipulate the DOM dynamically. Mastering directives enables you to efficiently control the rendering and behavior of your components.
    </li>
    <li class="null">
      <b>Reactivity and Data Binding:</b> Vue's reactivity system is at the core of its simplicity and efficiency.
      Understanding how to establish reactive data bindings, work with computed properties, and set up watchers will
      help you build responsive and data-driven applications.
    </li>
    <li class="null">
      <b>Options API:</b> Familiarize yourself with the Options API, which is still prevalent in existing Vue 2 projects and
      codebases. Understanding the Options API will enable you to maintain and enhance Vue 2 applications, as well as
      collaborate with legacy codebases.
    </li>
    <li class="null">
      <b>Composition API:</b> Gain a deep understanding of the Composition API, which allows you to organize component logic
      into
      reusable and composable functions. Explore the benefits of using the Composition API over the Options API, including
      improved code organization and reusability.
    </li>
    <li class="null">
      <b>Vue Router:</b> Vue Router allows you to implement client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between
      different views. Learn how to define routes, handle dynamic routing, and implement nested routes to create robust
      SPA (Single-Page Applications).

  <summary>Python</summary>
  <h4 id="bkmrk-description-of-pytho">Description of Python</h4>

  <p>Python is a highly recommended language for programmers, regardless of their skill level, due to its simplicity,
    efficiency, and robust capabilities. Its syntax is clear and easy to read, making it straightforward to grasp
    fundamental programming concepts. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows
    programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. As a
    result, Python enables you to write functional programs with less code and less complexity.

    Python's versatility is another significant advantage. It is employed across numerous industries and applications,
    including web and software development, data analysis and visualization, artificial intelligence, machine learning,
    and scientific computing. Python's extensive standard library and an abundance of third-party packages, such as
    NumPy for numerical computing, pandas for data manipulation, Django and Flask for web development, and TensorFlow
    for machine learning, allow you to accomplish a great deal with Python right out of the box. This capability makes
    Python a language that you can stick with as you advance in your career, from beginner to expert, without the need
    to switch languages.

    Python's vibrant and welcoming community is another crucial benefit. You'll have access to a wealth of resources,
    including comprehensive documentation, a plethora of tutorials and guides suitable for all skill levels, and
    numerous forums and chat groups where you can seek advice and help. Furthermore, Python's widespread usage means
    that there are ample job opportunities in a variety of fields. In summary, Python's ease of learning, power,
    versatility, and robust community support make it an ideal programming language for developers..</p>
